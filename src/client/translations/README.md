## HELLO! 🖐🏽

As JSON does not support comments, I thought it'd be interesting to add some translations guidelines here. Please read this file before translation new contents.

The translations files are divided by three sections: *actions*, *text* and *time*. I'll be explaining these sections below.

The *actions* section holds all the buttons translations. That's all. If you have to translate something and you're in doubt if it'd be a _actions_ or a _text_ item, just take a look if it's inside a button. If so, it's a **actions** item.

The *text* section holds all the rest (that is, that's not inside a button! 😂), except time-related strings.

The *time* section holds all the time-related strings. They are used to format dates, minutes, seconds... It's interesting and clean to keep them here. They're the only strings that are going to be formatted.

Thanks for reading and if you have any doubts, [I'm at your service](https://github.com/pedrowindisch).
